# Lottery Web Scraper
I built this web scraper to grab the winning numbers from two lottery sites in Curacao that do not have APIs. One of them is text based when announcing winners, while the other is image based. It then outputs an HTML file that can be used with PHP to display these lottery numbers on a website.
