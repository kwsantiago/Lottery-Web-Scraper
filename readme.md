# Lottery Web Scraper
I built this web scraper to grab the winning numbers from two lottery sites in Curacao that do not have APIs. [One of them](http://www.robbieslottery.com/) is text based when announcing winners, while [the other](http://landsloterij.org/eng/index.aspx) is image based. It then outputs an HTML file that can be used with PHP to display these lottery numbers on a website.
